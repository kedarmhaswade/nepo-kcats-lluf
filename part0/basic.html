    Web development changes fast, but some things will change rather slowly. The
    interplay between three pieces of technology is of essence:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML decides the structure of the document.</li>
    <li>CSS(s) determine the presentation or form of the
        elements of the document. If everything else remains
        the same, a change in CSS will uniformly change the
        look and feel of the documents on a website.
    </li>
    <li>JavaScript (as of now) determines the behavior
        of the elements of the document.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I think humans should learn to live peacefully. Looking around the globe, one does not fail to notice the strange
    situation
    we are in: War, terrorism, injustice, ignorance, dishonesty. Sigh.

    Perhaps we should realize that the power of love is more worthwhile than the love of power.

    Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web
    site or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally
    sent to a web server for processing and storage (see Sending form data later
    in the module), or used on the client-side to immediately update the
    interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or
    hide a UI feature).
</p>
<p>
    A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called
    widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form
    — they are often referred to as HTML forms.

<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" value="default: Joe">
        </li>
        <li>
            <label for="mail">E-mail:</label>
            <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_email">
        </li>
        <li>
            <label for="msg">Message:</label>
            <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
        </li>
        <li class="button">
            <button type="submit">Send your message</button>
            <input type="reset">
        </li>
    </ul>
</form>
